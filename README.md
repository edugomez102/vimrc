# DISCONTINUED !!!! check https://github.com/edugomez102/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim

# ðŸ˜ŽMy vim configðŸ˜Ž

![exit vim](nojoke.png)

Currently using nvim on Windows 10 ðŸ˜žðŸ’”

## Installation

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/edugomez102/vimrc
    mv vimrc .vim && cd .vim
    mkdir undo-dir sessions
    vim -c VimscriptPlugins -c qa

or just clone the repo and run `vimrc/install.sh`

then open vim and run `:PlugInstall` if you want to install non-vimscript
plugins  
note that some of them require dependencies

### My recommendation for LSP autocompletition

1. run `:CocInstall coc-marketplace`
2. then run `:CocList marketplace`
3. search for the language you want coc.nvim to autocomplete!
